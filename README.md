Time Series data:
  Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is   the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
  Over here we are trying to analyse BTC data and forecast its price.

Prophet Model:
  Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday         effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and   typically handles outliers well.
  
Yahoo Finance:
  YFinance is highly recommended for Financial Reporting as it not only downloads the Stock Price data but also allows us to download all the financial data of a Company since its   listing in the stock market.
